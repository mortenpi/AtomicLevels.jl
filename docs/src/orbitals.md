Atomic orbitals, i.e. single particle states with well-defined orbital or total angular
momentum, are usually the basic building blocks of atomic states. AtomicLevels provides
types and methods to label orbital

## Orbital types

AtomicLevels provides two basic types for labelling atomic orbitals: [`Orbital`](@ref) and
[`RelativisticOrbital`](@ref). Stricly speaking, these types do not label orbitals, but
groups of orbitals with the same angular symmetry and radial behaviour (i.e. a
[subshell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_shell#Subshells)).

The [`SpinOrbital`](@ref) type can be used to fully qualify all the quantum numbers (that
is, also ``m_\ell`` and ``m_s``) of an [`Orbital`](@ref). It represent a since, distinct
orbital.

The string macros [`@o_str`](@ref) and [`@ro_str`](@ref) can be used to conveniently contruct
orbitals, while [`@os_str`](@ref) and [`@ros_str`](@ref) can be used to construct whole lists
of them very easily.
